5.	Then You have New Tab open as a Terminal[CLI]  In Browser login with username by default. So you have to Switch To Root for that type ```
sudo -s
``` and hit Enter. Now You are root so you have to Update ang upgrade your instance by using 
       ```
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
```
 command. And update it.
6.	When your machine is upgraded you have to install a apache2 server. Apache is a popular open-source, cross-platform web server that is, by the numbers, the most popular web server in existence. For Installing apache2 just type       
         ```
apt-get install apache2
```
 and hit enter and then it prompt you to install yes or no. Just you have to type ```
Y
``` and enter.
7. Now your apache2 is install but not started. We have to start apache2 by typing the command ```
service apache2 start
```
8.	Now we have Default server so you have edit the HTTP servers index file. The file is stored in /var/www/html/ so you have go to that directory by using ```
cd
```command. And then check the index file is there or not by using ```
ls -a
``` command. 
9.	For welcome landing page we edit the index.html file by nano command i.e ```
nano index.html
``` and then edit your welcome landing page ```
(ex - Hello, Welcome to My New Web Server! ðŸ˜Š) .
``` And save it.
